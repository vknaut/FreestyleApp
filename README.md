# Freestyle Helper App

Welcome to the Freestyle Helper App's GitHub repository! This innovative application, designed using Python, leverages the Pygame library for rendering visuals and Tkinter for dialog-based user interaction. Its primary purpose is to aid freestyle artists in their practice sessions by providing random words to rhyme with, and enabling the addition, edition, and deletion of rhymes for each word.

#### Features

- **Dynamic Word Display**: Switch between a timed mode for automatic word changes and an on-demand mode to navigate words manually.
- **Rhyme Management**: Add, edit, and delete rhymes for the displayed word using intuitive Tkinter dialog boxes.
- **Data Persistence**: Words are loaded from a text file, and rhymes are managed in separate text files, ensuring your additions and changes are saved across sessions.

#### Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher recommended).
   - Pygame and Tkinter must be installed. You can install Pygame using pip:
     ```
     pip install pygame
     ```

     Tkinter usually comes with Python, but if you need to install it, refer to the official Tkinter documentation for your platform.
